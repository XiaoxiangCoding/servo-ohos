"""Check that every mozjs entry in Servo's usage scope has a contract case.

Usage: check_api_coverage.py COVERAGE.jsonl MANIFEST.toml SCOPE.toml

The JSON Lines input is one of the files written by `CONTRACT_OUT`. Each case must list the mozjs
entry points it calls in its `apis` field. Only entries in `SCOPE.toml` are required to have a
case: that is the surface Servo actually uses. Entries outside the scope are validated against
the manifest but do not affect coverage. Every case must still exercise at least one scoped
entry: the suite only keeps cases for Servo's usage surface.

Every scoped entry must be exercised by a case. `implemented` entries count as normal coverage;
`empty` and `todo` entries are counted separately because their case records what the shim does
today (silent no-op or a `qjs_todo!` panic), and any behavioural difference is settled by
`known-differences.toml` during the QuickJS diff. A case may only claim an entry with the status
the manifest gives it, so a case cannot pass an unimplemented entry off as working.
